Exploring-Hotel-Booking-Data--Using-Python 
The "Exploring Hotel Booking Data" project utilizes Python to analyze hotel booking data, uncovering insights into booking patterns, customer preferences, and hotel performance. Through data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis, the project aims to identify trends, such as peak booking periods and popular amenities. By understanding these patterns, businesses can optimize pricing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall performance. This project provides actionable insights to drive decision-making and enhance the hospitality experience.
